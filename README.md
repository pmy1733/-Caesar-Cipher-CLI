## Project name

Week Two IP : **Command Line Caesar Cipher**
## Project description
A Caesar cipher is a type of substitution in which each letter is shifted a certain number of places also known as a key, down the alphabet.  For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.

## BDD.
*Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding, and decoding. 
*The key is an integer from 1 to 25. 
*This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). 
*The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). 
*So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC".
